# Resource Roundup
A react app with passport authentication that compiles resources from the 2019 Part Time Full Stack Web Development Women's Cohort Boot Camp. 

With Resource Roundup all your resources are available in one place! No more getting lost in GitLab or scrolling endlessly through Slack to find resources that have probably been autodeleted because you sent one too many cat gifs. In Resource Roundup, students have the option to "favorite" their go-to documents, videos, and more so they're always available for easy access. The "like" or "dislike" feature reflects to fellow students as well as administrators which resources are most useful and which are less than optimal. Save comments on cards to remind yourself and your fellow students what was most helpful or where to look next. Administrators have the opportunity to post new resources as well.
